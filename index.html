      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Doctor's Garely and Liberman are now among the first Board Certified physicians in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row feature design">
      <div class="six columns right">
        <h3>Knowledgeable. Experienced. Caring.</h3>
        <p>The field of Urogynecology is relatively new. This specialty, now called Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery, requires a full residency in either Ob/Gyn or Urology followed by either two or three years of formal fellowship training. Physicians who complete this rigorous training path are uniquely qualified to care for women with pelvic floor disorders. Because of the scarcity of training programs throughout the US, most medical centers do not have a specialist in this area. Dr. Garely is a Clinical Associate Professor at Mount Sinai, which is one of only 2 medical centers in New York with an accredited fellowship program. As a fellowship graduate in Urogynecology, Dr. Garely has been practicing the longest in the New York City area. </p>
        <p>The first board exam used to certify doctors who practice Urogynecology was given in June, 2013. Both Drs. Garely and Liberman are now Board-Certified in this specialty, in addition to being certified in general obstetrics and gynecology.
        Female pelvic floor disorders can be the source of great anxiety. Common symptoms include loss of bladder control (leaking ) when coughing, laughing, sneezing, or exercising (stress incontinence). Sometimes, the problem involves having to go to the bathroom frequently, or not being able to sleep through the night because of constant urges (overactive bladder). Often, women can have the sensation of pelvic pressure, or feeling a "bulge" in the vagina (uterine or vaginal prolapse). Sometimes women can have problems after previous surgery which can lead to pelvic pain, or openings that can form between the bladder, rectum, and vagina (fistula's). Rarely, some women are born with congenital problems which can affect their sexual function. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div id="answers">
          <h4>Do I need to see a urogynecologist?
          </h4>
          <p>If you answer "yes" to any of the following questions, Dr. Garely can help:
            ​
            -Do you ever leak urine when you cough, laugh, sneeze, exercise, run, or engage in sexual relations?
            -Do you ever feel that you can not "delay" running to the bathroom?
            -Do you ever find that if you don't get to the bathroom fast enough that you will have an accident?
            -Do you wake up at night to urinate?
            -Do you feel that you don't empty your bladder after urinating?
            -Do you feel pressure in your vagina?
            -Do you see or feel a bulge in the vagina or rectum?
            -Did anyone ever tell you that your "bladder has dropped"?
            -Did your physician tell you that you need surgery for incontinence or pelvic prolapse?
            -Do you ever have to change positions or put your fingers in or around your vaginal area to help urinate or have a bowel movement?</p>
          <h4> Does Dr. Garely do surgery on patients who "only" need a hysterectomy and no other reconstructive procedures?
          </h4>
          <p>Dr. Garely is one of the most experienced gynecologic surgeons in the country. Assuming that the hysterectomy is absolutely indicated, Dr. Garely will review surgical options and help you make the best choice tailored to your problem and perceptions.</p>
          <h4>Will Dr. Garely operate on elderly or sick patients? </h4>
          <p>Yes. Many physicians employ "rules" that ensure they only operate on extremely healthy patients. Dr. Garely knows that the "average" patient is not always thin, young, or without medical problems. Having trained and worked at some of the nations best medical centers, Dr. Garely is an expert in taking care of "high risk" patients. Working with the patients own primary care providers, Dr. Garely can usually prepare even the sickest and oldest patients for successful surgery when indicated. All of the hospitals that he operates at have specialists who help him manage complicated patients.
          </p>
          <h4>Can my surgery be done without general anesthesia?
          </h4>
          <p>Yes. In almost every case other than laparoscopy, a spinal or epidural anesthesia can be used. This is always discussed prior to surgery and face-to-face consultation with the anesthesiologist can be arranged well in advance of the operation if indicated.
          </p>
          <h4>Can cosmetic procedures be combined with surgery for incontinence and pelvic prolapse?</h4>
          <p>Yes. This is a perfect time for concurrent procedures. Patients only need one anesthesia, and operating room costs are usually significantly lower. Labial re-shaping, and vaginal tightening can be done by Dr. Garely. If "tummy tucks", liposuction, or breast surgery is desired, Dr. Garely can recommend some of the top plastic surgeons in the NY area to participate in the surgery. Insurance will usually cover a large part of the costs.
          </p>
        <h4>Do you use the DaVinci Robot to do hysterectomy's and pelvic prolapse surgery?
          </h4>
        <p>When the use of the robot is indicated, members of Dr. Garely's team are the most experienced in the tri-state area. Most patients are surprised to learn that robotic procedures usually take 2-3 times longer than straight laparoscopic surgery, often with more incisions. Robotic procedures can take 4-5 times longer than Dr. Garely's "mini-laparotomy" incision, with multiple small visible incisions on the abdomen compared to his one small incision right over the pubic bone. When consulting any surgeon who promises to do your surgery with the robot, be sure to ask how many cases they have done, and how long the average case will take.  The most experienced pelvic surgeons in the world are able to do this type of surgery with minimally invasive techniques without subjecting our patients to the prolonged operative times associated with the robot, unless it is in the patients best interest.
        </p>
        <h4>If I am referred to Dr. Garely but would like to see Dr. Liberman instead, is that OK?</h4>
        <p>We work as team in the Long Island office and it is never a problem if you would prefer to see Dr. Liberman. For many of our Russian speaking patients this is actually encouraged. We want our patients to feel comfortable with the care they receive.

        <h4>Do you have experience with removing mesh or treating patients that have had complications from mesh?
        </h4>
        <p>Dr. Garely is among the most experiened surgeons in the country for the treatment of mesh complications. He removes mesh on a weekly basis. Patients are referred into his New York practice from all over the country.

          <h4>How many days will I be in the hospital?
          </h4>
          <p>This depends on the type of surgery performed. In most cases, patients are discharged either on the day of surgery or within 24 hours. No one is "pushed" out of the hospital, and Dr. Garely can usually arrange for a visiting nurse to check on patients at home. Dr. Garely has a very low rate of post-operative infections. This is partly because patients leave the hospital quickly, decreasing the risk of picking up "hospital acquired infections".
          </p>
          <h4>Does Dr. Garely do the surgery himself, or do residents and fellows do the work?
          </h4>
          <p>Pelvic reconstructive surgery is very complicated. To maintain his high success rates, Dr. Garely does every major step of the operation himself. Residents and fellows participate in the operation, but his operating room is not a place where anyone "practices" on patients. Dr. Garely will "teach" during his operations, but this is done by demonstration, not trial and error. Residents and fellows are integral to the pre and post-operative care of patients. They are in the hospital 24 hours a day and are involved with the minute to minute care. None of Dr. Garely's assistants does anything without consulting with him first. Because his partners are the Chairman of the Department (Dr. Brodman) and the Director of Gynecology (Dr. Ascher- Walsh), Dr. Garely has immediate access and coverage from two of the best surgeons in New York City.
          </p>
          <h4>Do all patients in the practice need surgery?
          </h4>
          <p>No. Less than half of Dr. Garely's patients end up with a surgical procedure. Most patients can be successfully managed with medication or a pessary. Some patients are referred to physical therapists who specialize in pelvic floor disorders and incontinence treatment. Dr. Garely is committed to keeping patients out of the operating room. Unless it is absolutely indicated, Dr, Garely will never tell a patient that they "need" an operation.
          </p>
          <h4>Do I need to have my uterus removed during a vaginal prolapse surgery?
          </h4>
          <p>No. This is a highly negotiable point. In some cases removal of part of the uterus can aid in the repair. Total removal of the uterus is rarely done, and then only in cases where there are abnormal cells or pre-cancer of the cervix. By preserving the lower part of the uterus and cervix, there is no cutting of the vagina, which significantly decreases complications during the repair. While it is not known whether removal of the cervix will impair sexual function, Dr. Garely errs on the side of conservatism, and takes no chances. Patients who desire future fertility will need special counseling to help them make important decisions .
          </p>
          <h4>Do I need to have my ovaries removed if I am having surgery?</h4>
          <p>No. It is currently recommended that patients under 65 keep their ovaries so that they don't increase their risk of heart disease. Taking into consideration each patients cancer history, cancer risk factors and family history, Dr. Garely can tailor a pre-operative plan that is acceptable to each patient. When accessible, the ovaries are visually inspected by Dr. Garely. If they appear abnormal, only then will they be removed. 
          </p>
          <h4>I have heard or read bad things about synthetic mesh. Do you use this material?
          </h4>
          <p>Yes. Most mesh used in pelvic reconstructive surgery is made of a material called polypropylene. This is commonly called "Proline". Pelvic prolapse and incontinence is often caused because of a weakness or absence of normal muscle and ligaments. To compensate for these weaknesses, we need to use materials that can reconstruct or recreate the normal anatomy. We have tried to do this by using the patients own tissues. Unfortunately, this has resulted in high failure rates. In a quest to achieve better results, new formulations of Proline have been developed. This new material is very safe. 
​
          These new mesh products are thinner, lighter, and less prone to cause complications. Complications include erosion (where the mesh finds its way into the vagina, bladder, or bowel), infection, pelvic pain, and pain during
          ​
          sexual relations. Research studies have shown that mesh placed through the vagina to fix vaginal prolapse has a much higher rate of complications than mesh applied through an abdominal or laparoscopic incision (often less than 1%). Mesh used for incontinence procedures have very low complication rates (less than 1%).
          ​
          When considering the safety of any mesh product or procedure, the skill of the surgeon implanting the material is of paramount importance. Some of the finest surgeons in the world use vaginally applied mesh with low complication rates. As a matter of practice, Dr. Garely usually will not use any mesh applied through a vaginal incision to correct prolapse. With years of experience, Dr. Garely is one of the country's foremost experts in the management of mesh complications. </p>
